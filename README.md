# MarvAuth - TOTP Authenticator Example

This project is a simple **Streamlit** app that demonstrates how to implement Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) authentication using the **pyotp** library. The app generates a TOTP QR code that users can scan with their authenticator apps (like **Google Authenticator** or **Microsoft Authenticator**) and allows users to validate the OTP generated by their authenticator app.

## Features

- **TOTP (RFC 6238)**: The app uses the TOTP algorithm to generate and validate OTPs.
- **QR Code Generation**: A QR code is generated for the user to scan with their authenticator app.
- **OTP Validation**: The app validates the OTP entered by the user.

## How It Works

1. The user enters a **unique User Key** for enrollment.
2. A **secret key** is generated, and a QR code is displayed. The user scans this code using an authenticator app.
3. The user can then enter the OTP generated by the app, and the system will validate the OTP against the secret key.

## Requirements

The project requires the following dependencies:

```txt
streamlit==1.22.0
pyotp==2.6.0
qrcode==7.3.1
Pillow==9.2.0
